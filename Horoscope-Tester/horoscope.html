<div id="choice_page">
	<p id="Aries">You may feel as if people have turned against you today and that they've suddenly lost interest in what you have to say, Aries. Maybe this is a reflection of your own inability to truly listen to someone else talking. Look at the collective picture and open your eyes to the world around you. Get involved in the community instead of only focusing on you all the time.</p>
	<p id="Taurus">Let your emotions play with your imagination today, and feel free to discuss your findings openly with others, Taurus. Don't get caught up in so rational a frame of mind that you refuse to acknowledge any other way of viewing a current situation. Put away your analytical side in order to disclose a more abstract, intuitive perspective. Exercise that part of your brain that doesn't normally get used.</p>
	<p id="Gemini">Trust that you have all the facts you need today, Gemini. You should be feeling quite good, emotionally. Use this self-confidence to make great strides in whatever you want to accomplish. Have fun letting your mind drift to a fanciful world where it can explore your imaginative proclivities. Feel free to use your strong hold on facts as a base to take off into a highly creative and intuitive realm.</p>
	<p id="Cancer">You may find yourself emotionally challenged today by a strong force demanding your attention, Cancer. Your hyperawareness to every situation might be driving you a bit crazy. Perhaps you just need to tone things down and relax. Enjoy rather than question the fun-loving energy of the day. The more you simply let loose and explore, the better off you'll be.</p>
	<p id="Leo">You have the opportunity to do some intense self-healing today, Leo, so you communicate more directly with your core self without the distractions of other people. Do what you can to hone in on the internal issues that require your attention. It's key that you learn how to address these issues yourself instead of relying on other people to take care of these needs for you today.</p>
	<p id="Virgo">You might be a bit confused with the mood of the day, Virgo, which fosters quick action and a sporadic approach to things. More than likely, this approach isn't exactly in line with your usual methodical protocol. Do what you can to merge with this energy in order to add a more spontaneous spark to your daily routine. Take a walk on the wild side today.</p>
	<p id="Libra">Feel free to match your plaid pants with your paisley shirt today, Libra. Accessorize with wild sneakers and a striped jacket. Let the oddball within you shine brightly! This is a terrific day for you, and you should feel free to express yourself openly and loudly to the world. You should experience a great deal of self-confidence. Take full advantage of it at this time.</p>
	<p id="Scorpio">Feel free to enlist your own creativity today to solve any problem that may come your way, Scorpio. Don't feel like you absolutely need to take a rational and methodical approach. This sort of frame of mind has already been tried. Now it's time to explore a more intuitive way to complete any task that you wish to tackle now. Exercise more of your sensitive nature.</p>
	<p id="Sagittarius">The energy of the day is electric, and you could find yourself bouncing from task to task and person to person, Sagittarius. Things are apt to happen when you least expect them, so be prepared for surprises. There's an element of genius to the day that might inspire you to be someone much greater than you ever thought you could be. Join with people who share your same zest for life.</p>
	<p id="Capricorn">You might feel as if your heart is playing tricks on you today, Capricorn. Perhaps you're coming up against a strong force that's causing you to doubt yourself in some way. Don't be conned by loud, obnoxious talk. Seek the true meaning behind the words. You'll find that most of your strength is internal. Be prepared for stubborn wills to make a powerful presence in your world today.</p>
	<p id="Aquarius">There is a great deal of unexpected communication coming your way today, Aquarius, but be careful about the people you trust. There's an element of fantasy factored into the picture. This might cause some disruption if you automatically accept everything at face value. Make sure you check your sources at least twice before proceeding. You'll be much better off if you prepare for the worst.</p>
	<p id="Pisces">You may find that people aren't necessarily very sympathetic to your feelings today, Pisces. It's quite possible that they're more responsive to facts and information than emotions. It could be that you need to enlist some sort of translator in order to get through to a person with whom you're trying to communicate. Don't hesitate to ask for more clarification on something if you need it.</p>
